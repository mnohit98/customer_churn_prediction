# Customer Churn Prediction - Quick Presentation Outline

## ⏱️ 5-Minute Video Structure

### SLIDE 1: Title & Introduction (30 seconds)
**Say:**
- "Hi, I'm [Your Name], and today I'm presenting my Customer Churn Prediction Project"
- "Customer churn is when customers stop using a service - it's expensive for businesses"
- "My goal: Build an ML model to predict which customers will churn"

---

### SLIDE 2: The Problem (15 seconds)
**Say:**
- "27% of customers churn - that's a huge business problem"
- "It costs 5-25x more to acquire new customers than retain existing ones"
- "Early prediction = proactive retention = saved revenue"

---

### SLIDE 3: What I Did - Overview (30 seconds)
**Say:**
- "I followed a complete ML pipeline in 4 phases:"
- "1. Explored and cleaned 7,000+ customer records"
- "2. Trained 3 different ML models"
- "3. Evaluated and compared their performance"
- "4. Built prediction functions for new customers"

---

### SLIDE 4: Data Exploration Highlights (30 seconds)
**Show:**
- Churn distribution chart
- Key findings: "Month-to-month customers churn 42% vs 3% for 2-year contracts"
- "Tenure, payment method, and charges are strong predictors"

---

### SLIDE 5: Models I Built (30 seconds)
**Say:**
- "I trained three models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost"
- "Random Forest performed best with 80% accuracy"
- "Used Grid Search for hyperparameter tuning"

---

### SLIDE 6: Tools & Technologies (20 seconds)
**Show:**
- Python logo
- Libraries: Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib
- "All open-source, industry-standard tools"

---

### SLIDE 7: How It Works - Simple Explanation (45 seconds)
**Say:**
- "Random Forest creates multiple decision trees"
- "Each tree votes, majority wins"
- "Example: Customer with month-to-month contract, low tenure, high charges"
- "Model predicts: 75% probability of churn = HIGH RISK"
- "Business can intervene with retention offer"

---

### SLIDE 8: Key Insights (30 seconds)
**Show:**
- Feature importance chart
- "Top predictors: Contract type, Tenure, Payment method"
- "Business actions: Target month-to-month customers, reward long-tenure, promote auto-pay"

---

### SLIDE 9: Results & Performance (30 seconds)
**Show:**
- Performance metrics table
- "80% accuracy, 0.85 ROC-AUC"
- "Can predict churn for new customers instantly"
- "Provides probability scores for risk assessment"

---

### SLIDE 10: Business Impact (30 seconds)
**Say:**
- "This model helps businesses:"
- "Identify at-risk customers early"
- "Target retention campaigns effectively"
- "Reduce customer acquisition costs"
- "Increase customer lifetime value"

---

### SLIDE 11: Summary & Conclusion (25 seconds)
**Say:**
- "I built a complete ML solution from data to predictions"
- "Achieved 80% accuracy in predicting churn"
- "Provides actionable business insights"
- "Ready for real-world deployment"
- "Thank you!"
